# Enable mouse scroll
# Note: This might work only after killing the tmux server with `tmux kill-server`.
# 1. To save you having to scroll to the bottom again before typing, you can hit `q` to exit scroll mode.
# 2. This setting breaks highlighting and copying text. Use `shift+click` to maintain this functionality.
